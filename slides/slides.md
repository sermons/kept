And I am no longer in the world, <br>
but they are in the world, <br>
and I am coming to you.

Holy Father, keep them in your name, <br>
which you have given me, <br>
that they may be one, even as we are one.

While I was with them,  <br>
I kept them in your name, <br>
which you have given me.

I have guarded them, and not one of them <br>
has been lost except the son of destruction, <br>
that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

But now I am coming to you, <br>

fulfilled in themselves.

I do not ask  <br>
that you take them out of the world, <br>
but that you keep them from the evil one.
